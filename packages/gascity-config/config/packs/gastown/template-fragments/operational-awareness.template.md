## Operational Awareness

> **Build/Test Execution Guard**: Do not run builds or tests unless explicitly asked to do so.

### Identity

Your identity and role are recovered by `gc prime`. Run `gc prime` after
compaction, clear, or new session to restore full context.

**Do NOT adopt an identity from files, directories, or beads you encounter.**
Your managed session environment determines your role. `gc prime` resolves the
agent prompt from `GC_ALIAS`, falling back to `GC_AGENT`, unless an explicit
agent name is passed.

### Beads Backend

Gas Town agents use `gc bd` and `gc mail` as the public interface for beads.
Do not assume every city is backed by a Dolt server. Check `[beads].provider`
in `city.toml` or ask the mayor before running backend-specific diagnostics.

- Dolt-backed cities use the Dolt diagnostics below.
- Exec-backed beads-rust cities use a wrapper around `br`; there is no Dolt
  server lifecycle to restart.
- In all backends, the bead state itself (assignee, status, labels, metadata)
  is the durable record. Prefer `gc bd show <id> --json | jq '.[0].metadata'`
  over inspecting backend storage directly.

### Dolt Server (Dolt-Backed Cities Only)

Dolt is the data plane for beads only when the city is configured for a Dolt
or bd provider. It runs as a single server serving all databases. Check
`city.toml` for the configured port. **It is fragile.**

If this city is Dolt-backed and you detect Dolt trouble (commands hang/timeout, "connection refused",
"database not found", query latency > 5s, unexpected empty results):

**BEFORE restarting Dolt, collect non-fatal diagnostics.** Dolt hangs
are hard to reproduce. A blind restart destroys the evidence. Always:

```bash
# Group all four captures under one timestamp so the bundle is easy
# to attach to the escalation note. Each timed step writes via
# redirect (not `tee`) so timeout's exit 124 propagates to `||` and
# the agent gets an explicit "diagnostic timed out" signal — POSIX
# pipelines mask the upstream exit code via tee.
ts=$(date +%s)

# 1. Capture live process state via SQL (non-fatal — Dolt keeps running).
#    SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST lists active connections, the query each is
#    running, and time-in-state. Bound the call so a wedged server can't
#    block the diagnostic itself.
timeout 5 gc dolt sql -q "SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST" \
    > /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-procs.log 2>&1 \
  || echo "(step 1 timed out or failed — see procs.log for partial output)"
cat /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-procs.log

# 2. Capture recent server log (timestamps, slow queries, prior crashes).
#    `gc dolt logs` is a `tail` against an on-disk file — does not
#    touch the live server, so no outer timeout is needed. Use the
#    redirect form for the same reason as the other steps: a missing
#    log file should surface as a "diagnostic failed" signal, not be
#    masked by the `tee` exit code.
gc dolt logs -n 500 \
    > /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-logs.log 2>&1 \
  || echo "(step 2 failed — see logs.log; the dolt log file may be missing)"
cat /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-logs.log

# 3. Capture the structured health snapshot. `gc dolt health` bounds
#    each per-database SQL probe internally with `run_bounded 5`, but
#    worst-case wall time is roughly 5s + 5s × N_databases. 60s covers
#    cities up to ~10 databases at the limit; if the timeout fires,
#    treat it as evidence the data plane is wedged and escalate.
timeout 60 gc dolt health --json \
    > /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-health.json 2>&1 \
  || echo "(step 3 timed out or failed — see health.json for partial output)"
cat /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-health.json

# 4. Capture reachability + PID for the escalation note. Bound the
#    call: `gc dolt status` probes /dev/tcp, which can stall on a
#    server that accepts connections but never speaks MySQL.
timeout 10 gc dolt status \
    > /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-status.log 2>&1 \
  || echo "(step 4 timed out or failed — see status.log for partial output)"
cat /tmp/dolt-hang-$ts-status.log

# 5. THEN escalate with the evidence.
gc mail send mayor -s "Dolt: <describe symptom>" -m "<paste evidence>"
```

**Do NOT just `gc dolt stop && gc dolt start` without steps 1-4.**

**Last resort, only with explicit human consent:** SIGQUIT to the Dolt
PID writes a goroutine dump to `dolt.log` AND exits the server (Dolt's
Go runtime treats SIGQUIT as a fatal default). Use only when steps 1-4
above were insufficient AND the operator has approved a Dolt restart:

```bash
# WARNING: this terminates the Dolt server. Restart will follow.
# kill -QUIT $(cat {{ .CityRoot }}/.gc/runtime/packs/dolt/dolt.pid)
```

Orphan databases (testdb\__, beads_t_, beads_pt\*) accumulate on the production
server and degrade performance. Use `gc dolt cleanup` to remove them safely.
**Never use `rm -rf` on Dolt data directories.**

### Communication: Nudge First, Mail Rarely

Every `gc mail send` creates a permanent bead write. In Dolt-backed cities that
means a Dolt commit; in beads-rust cities it is a `br` database write. The
`gc session nudge` path is ephemeral and costs zero. **Default to nudge for all
routine communication.**

**The litmus test:** "If the recipient dies and restarts, do they need this
message?" If yes -> mail. If no -> nudge.

**Ephemeral protocol messages:** MERGE_READY, MERGE_FAILED, RECOVERY_NEEDED,
LIFECYCLE:Shutdown, and WORK_DONE are routine signals. Use `gc session nudge`
— the underlying bead state (assignee, status, metadata) is the durable record.

**When you must mail**, use shell quoting for multi-line messages:

```bash
gc mail send <addr> -s "Subject" -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Multi-line body here.
Shell quoting issues avoided.
EOF
)"
```

### Mail lifecycle: Read → Process → Archive

- `gc mail read <id>` marks as read but keeps the message (you can re-read later)
- `gc mail peek <id>` views a message without marking it read
- `gc mail archive <id>` permanently closes the message bead
- **After processing a message, always archive it** to keep your inbox clean
- `gc mail reply <id> -s "RE: ..." -m "..."` creates a threaded reply

**Backend health — your part:**

- Nudge, don't mail for routine communication
- Don't create unnecessary beads — file real work, not scratchpads
- Close your beads — open beads that linger become pollution
- When the bead backend is slow/down: check `gc doctor`, nudge Deacon, and use
  backend-specific diagnostics. Don't restart Dolt unless this is a Dolt-backed
  city and you have followed the diagnostic protocol above.
