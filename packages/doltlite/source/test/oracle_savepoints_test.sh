# Oracle test: savepoints, rollbacks, and transaction boundaries
# against stock SQLite.
#
# Savepoints are a dense corner of the prolly btree layer: each
# SAVEPOINT snapshots the in-memory catalog and the per-table
# pending mutmap state; ROLLBACK TO walks the stack to revert
# both. Any mismatch between snapshot and restore surfaces as a
# row that shouldn't exist or is missing after the rollback.
#
# Oracle target is stock sqlite3 built from the same tree so both
# engines parse identical SQLite SAVEPOINT syntax and the only
# variable is the storage layer's unwind logic.
#
# Coverage:
#   - BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK (full-transaction semantics)
#   - SAVEPOINT / RELEASE / ROLLBACK TO (partial revert)
#   - Nested savepoints (release-inner, rollback-inner, rollback-middle)
#   - Same-name shadowing (innermost wins)
#   - Savepoint over multi-table writes
#   - Savepoint over UPDATE and DELETE (not just INSERT)
#   - Savepoint over CREATE / DROP / ALTER TABLE
#   - Savepoint over triggered side effects (trigger body writes
#     to a second table; rollback has to revert both)
#   - In-place mutmap mutation transitions (INSERT→DELETE,
#     DELETE→INSERT, chained UPDATEs, UPSERT, REPLACE INTO, etc.)
#   - Bulk savepoint rollbacks (100/1000 rows)
#   - Savepoint-inside-BEGIN interaction
#   - Trigger RAISE(ROLLBACK) unwinding nested savepoints
#
# Usage: bash oracle_savepoints_test.sh [path/to/doltlite] [path/to/sqlite3]
