## Task Completion Requirements

- All of `bun fmt`, `bun lint`, and `bun typecheck` must pass before considering tasks completed.
- NEVER run `bun test`. Always use `bun run test` (runs Vitest).

## Project Snapshot

T3 Code is a minimal web GUI for using coding agents like Codex and Claude.

This repository is a VERY EARLY WIP. Proposing sweeping changes that improve long-term maintainability is encouraged.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Keep behavior predictable under load and during failures (session restarts, reconnects, partial streams).

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.

## Maintainability

Long term maintainability is a core priority. If you add new functionality, first check if there is shared logic that can be extracted to a separate module. Duplicate logic across multiple files is a code smell and should be avoided. Don't be afraid to change existing code. Don't take shortcuts by just adding local logic to solve a problem.

## Package Roles

- `apps/server`: Node.js WebSocket server. Wraps Codex app-server (JSON-RPC over stdio), serves the React web app, and manages provider sessions.
- `apps/web`: React/Vite UI. Owns session UX, conversation/event rendering, and client-side state. Connects to the server via WebSocket.
- `packages/contracts`: Shared effect/Schema schemas and TypeScript contracts for provider events, WebSocket protocol, and model/session types. Keep this package schema-only — no runtime logic.
- `packages/shared`: Shared runtime utilities consumed by both server and web. Uses explicit subpath exports (e.g. `@t3tools/shared/git`) — no barrel index.

## Codex App Server (Important)

T3 Code is currently Codex-first. The server starts `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC over stdio) per provider session, then streams structured events to the browser through WebSocket push messages.

How we use it in this codebase:

- Session startup/resume and turn lifecycle are brokered in `apps/server/src/codexAppServerManager.ts`.
- Provider dispatch and thread event logging are coordinated in `apps/server/src/providerManager.ts`.
- WebSocket server routes NativeApi methods in `apps/server/src/wsServer.ts`.
- Web app consumes orchestration domain events via WebSocket push on channel `orchestration.domainEvent` (provider runtime activity is projected into orchestration events server-side).

Docs:

- Codex App Server docs: https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk/#app-server

## Reference Repos

- Open-source Codex repo: https://github.com/openai/codex
- Codex-Monitor (Tauri, feature-complete, strong reference implementation): https://github.com/Dimillian/CodexMonitor

Use these as implementation references when designing protocol handling, UX flows, and operational safeguards.


# context-mem Integration

context-mem is active in this project. It compresses tool outputs via 14 content-aware summarizers (99% token savings) and serves optimized context through MCP.

## Workflow (IMPORTANT — follow this order)

1. **Session start**: Call `restore_session` to recover prior context
2. **Before re-reading files**: Call `search` first — the answer may already be stored
3. **After large outputs**: Call `observe` to compress and store content
4. **Need details on a search result?**: Call `get` with the ID — never guess content
5. **Need chronological context?**: Call `timeline` — optionally with `anchor` ID for before/after view
6. **When learning patterns**: Call `save_knowledge` for decisions, error fixes, API patterns
7. **Periodically**: Call `budget_status` — if >80%, call `restore_session` to save state and reclaim context

## Rules

- ALWAYS `search` before `get` — never guess observation IDs
- ALWAYS `observe` outputs over 500 tokens — keep context clean
- NEVER call `get` without first finding the ID via `search` or `timeline`
- When `budget_status` shows >80%: save your work, call `restore_session`

## Available MCP Tools

- `observe` — store and compress content (auto-summarized)
- `search` / `get` / `timeline` — retrieve stored context (use in this order)
- `stats` — view compression statistics
- `save_knowledge` / `search_knowledge` — persistent knowledge base
- `budget_status` / `budget_configure` — token budget management
- `emit_event` / `query_events` — event tracking
- `restore_session` — session continuity + context reclaim
